This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Pocketbase Admin UI.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

2. run the database:

```bash
./pocketbase serve
```
Open [http://127.0.0.1:8090](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/) with your browser to see the result.

## Next.js - The Full Course

[Next.js - The Full Course](https://fireship.io/courses/nextjs/)
Master the fundamentals of Next.js 13 and the App Router

Next.js - The Full Course provides a in-depth look into the Next.js App Router introduced in version 13.2. It puts React Server Components into practice by building a full-stack application from scratch with PostgreSQL and Prisma.

## What will I learn?

* 👨‍🎤 Everything you need to be productive with modern Next.js
* ⚡ Complex topics explained in 100 seconds
* 📚 Design patterns with React Server Components (RSC)
* 💎 How to choose optimal rendering strategies
* 🚅 Dynamic routing and project organization
* 🔥 Advanced data fetching and caching
* 👲 User authentication with Auth.js
* 📅 Data modeling with Postgres and Primsa
* 🤔 How to migrate from previous versions of Next.js

## 🦄 What will I build?
You will build a simple Social Media Platform inspired by sites like MySpace and Facebook where users can befriend each other. The goal of this project is to introduce you to Next’s rendering, data-fetching, and caching strategies.

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and expects some familiarity with React.js, JavaScript, and web development. The content is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and should be followed in a linear format.

## When was the course last updated?
Updated May 1st, 2023 next v13.4
